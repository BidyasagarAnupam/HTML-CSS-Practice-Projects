# HTML-CSS-Practice-Projects
Practice Projects to learn HTML5 &amp; CSS3 basics<br />
Most projects will have been done in the CodePen environment, so HTML file may only include contents within the body element.<br />
As these projects are for the purpose of practicing basics, the designs are not robust; they only focus on core concepts<br />
